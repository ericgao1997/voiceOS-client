@brenfan#9943 @Laura#3409 @paul#6857 @ushma#1162  @Fundai#8367 a few things.

1. There's a catch-up meeting with Lisa next week Monday at 2:30 in Lisa's office.  I may or may not be able to make it since my family will be in town due to convocation being the next day.  I'd want at least one of you to attend, probably everyone who can make it.

2. I haven't been feeling well the last week or so, and I probably should have sent this message a bit sooner.  I don't know how up I am to finishing trip planning, even with David's help.  Adding to this, I'll be busy next week with family for at least half of the week.  I don't want to say that ill completely step away, but I want to make sure that everything is done and that i don't miss anything.  A list of major planning items remaining is:

-How does the group get from place to place during the week?  Does the group just use Ubers?  If there is transit involved, what are the connections that we need to make?  What are the backup plans if people miss a bus or a train?   When do people drop off baggage, and how does baggage get between cities and hotels?  If someone has to travel with luggage, who is going to be designated to do this?  This is mainly what I want you three/four to do, if you can spare the time.  This was a major stress on us last year, even though things ended up going according to plan.  This needs to be done as soon as possible so that we know how much we have to pay for transit cards, and so that we can waive the $3 registration fee and have them delivered to the hotel if we do need them.

-Need to ensure the last 2 people have paid, and organize @ushma#1162 sending money to the SFSS & getting her waiver form filled out.  Need to ensure that everyone has signed the waiver form.  Either today or tomorrow, someone needs to go by the SFSS General Office and pick up the waiver forms so we can make sure that everyone has signed one.  If youre going to do this, send a message here.

-Need to organize a pre-leaving info session with the group, and maybe with someone from Coop / Career Services about networking.  I believe @Fundai#8367 said he'd be on this, but I know he has a busy week at least until wednesday.  Career Services is willing to do this, but paul and laura would remember how exciting that presentation was last year (it wasnt).

-Need to set up Lyft / Uber accounts for use while on the trip.  Need to designate who is going to be taking these charges on their credit cards (if you can't do this, let me know ASAP - also, check your credit card to make sure you don't get dinged for international travel by 10% per charge like i did last year).  All of you should make sure you have a decent credit limit, something hopefully $1000+.

-Need to designate someone as the primary leader / point of contact for visits to introduce the group and stuff.

-Need to figure out some way to make sure nobody gets lost, especially on the Sunday.

thats all I can think of for now.
